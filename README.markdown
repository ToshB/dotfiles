# toshb gets dotfiles inspiration from holman

## dotfiles

After reading about what Zach Holman did to get his dotfiles organized, I 
decided to try it for myself. These are my current dotfiles.
Take a look at [Zach's post to see what this stuff is about](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/toshb/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`, though.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.

You'll also want to change `git/gitconfig.symlink`, which will set you up as
committing as Zach Holman. You probably don't want that.

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `rake install`.

## what's inside

A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser
above and see what components may mesh up with you. Fork it, remove what you
don't use, and build on what you do use.

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `rake install`.
- **topic/\*.completion.sh**: Any files ending in `completion.sh` get loaded
  last so that they get loaded after we set up zsh autocomplete functions.

## add-ons

There are a few things I use to make my life awesome. They're not a required
dependency, but if you install them they'll make your life a bit more like a
bubble bath.

- If you want some more colors for things like `ls`, install grc: `brew install
  grc`.

## thanks

I forked [Zach Holman's](http://github.com/holman) excellent
[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) as I am too lazy to build my own setup
from scratch. Also, thanks to Zach for getting me to switch to Zsh.
